Try-Shopify!

If you want to sell something, an old X-box, a crochet unicorn, or a new gadget, where would you go?  If you aren't ready to take the plunge and open up an online store, Tryify is a solution for you!


Tryify enables people to discover you and your tiny shop by browsing a carousel of items in the homepage sorted by tags. This way locals can be connected to small businesses and gain patronage - ultimately influencing the success of these small businesses. Merchants get feedback on their products based on the feedback of all those who like their products. 

There is very little committment required, it is a one-click store that anyone can upload items onto. All visitors of the site are eligible to upload an item for sale. Accounts are created through Facebook so that you can view mutual friends and you can create an account with minimal effort.
